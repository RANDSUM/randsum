## What is this?

It's a dice roller, used for generating rolls that you might use in popular Tabletop Role-playing Games. It accepts basic number and number strings, as well as dice notation for more complicated dice operations.

Written in 100% Typescript, with strong overloading and attention to Arguments. You depend on `randsum` to give you what you expect - just not always the roll you want.

## Why did you make this?

Sometime around 2012, I decided I wanted to learn to program. I had installed ruby on the best laptop six-hundred dollars could buy, set to make a dice roller as an easy first project.

I spent an easy 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make `rand(n)` return `1...n` instead of `0...(n-1)`.

When I found the answer, I laughed and laughed. I've been chasing that high ever since.
