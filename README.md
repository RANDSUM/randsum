## Why did you make this?

Sometime around 2012, I decided I wanted to learn to program. I was living at my friends apartment rent-free, and I was using a banged up laptop. I had installed ruby, set to make a dice roller as an easy first project.

I spent an easy 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make `rand(n)` return `1-n` instead of `0-(n-1)`.

When I found the answer, I laughed and laughed. I've been chasing that high ever since.
