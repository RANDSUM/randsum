## Attributions

I looked high and wide for a consensus on a sort "Extended Standard Dice Notation", and could not find anything. The most extensive and thought-out documentation I found was for the game's [Sophie's Dice](https://sophiehoulden.com/dice/documentation/notation.html#keep). Thanks, [Sophie](https://www.patreon.com/SophieHoulden)! Your examples were invaluable. Consider buying their [games](https://sophieh.itch.io/)!

## Why did you make this?

Sometime around 2012, I decided I wanted to learn to program. I was living at my friends apartment rent-free, and I was using a banged up laptop. I had installed ruby, set to make a dice roller as an easy first project.

I spent an easy 30 minutes trying to figure out how to make `rand(n)` return `1-n` instead of `0-(n-1)`.

When I found the answer, I laughed and laughed. I've been chasing that high ever since.
