# RANDSUM 1.0.0 - Initial Release

We're excited to announce the initial stable release of RANDSUM, a comprehensive dice rolling library for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

## üé≤ What is RANDSUM?

RANDSUM is a powerful, extensible dice rolling system designed for tabletop gaming applications. It provides:

- **Advanced Notation**: Sophisticated dice notation supporting complex modifiers
- **Game System Integration**: Purpose-built packages for popular RPG systems
- **Developer-Friendly**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive documentation
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization and extension

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Rolling Engine

The `@randsum/roller` package provides the foundation with support for:

```typescript
import { roll } from '@randsum/roller';

// Basic rolling
roll('2d6+3');        // Standard dice with modifiers

// Advanced modifiers
roll('4d6L');         // Drop lowest (D&D ability scores)
roll('2d20H');        // Keep highest (advantage)
roll('3d6!');         // Exploding dice
roll('4d6R{1}');      // Reroll 1s
roll('5d20U');        // Unique results
roll('4d6C{<2,>5}');  // Capped results

// Custom faces
roll('2d{HT}');       // Coin flips
roll('1d{NSEW}');     // Directional dice
```

### Game System Packages

#### Blades in the Dark (`@randsum/blades`)
```typescript
import { bladesRoll } from '@randsum/blades';

const result = bladesRoll(3);
console.log(result.result); // "critical", "success", "partial", or "failure"
```

#### Daggerheart (`@randsum/daggerheart`)
```typescript
import { daggerheartRoll } from '@randsum/daggerheart';

const result = daggerheartRoll();
console.log(result.hope, result.fear); // Dual d12 mechanics
```

#### D&D 5th Edition (`@randsum/fifth`)
```typescript
import { advantageRoll, disadvantageRoll } from '@randsum/fifth';

const advantage = advantageRoll(5); // 2d20+5, keep higher
const disadvantage = disadvantageRoll(5); // 2d20+5, keep lower
```

### Applications

#### MCP Server (`@randsum/mcp-server`)
Enables AI assistants to perform dice rolling through the Model Context Protocol:

```bash
npm install -g @randsum/mcp-server
```

#### Discord Bot (`@randsum/discord-bot`)
Full-featured Discord bot for server-based dice rolling:

```
/roll 2d6+3
/advantage 1d20+5
/blades 3
```

#### CLI Tool (`@randsum/cli`)
Command-line interface for terminal-based rolling:

```bash
randsum "4d6L"
randsum "2d20H" --advantage
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation
