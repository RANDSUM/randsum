# Randsum Dice Notation

## What is Dice Notation?

[Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) is a way of representing different dice rolls and mutations in a simple string. For instance, `4d20+2` means "roll four twenty-sided die, then add two".

However, more complex operations - "Drop highest, reroll 3's, and make sure the rolls are unique" - do not always have a well-understood spec. This document describes the more complicated syntax that `randsum` will recognize.

I looked high and wide for a consensus on a sort "Extended Standard Dice Notation", and could not find anything. The most extensive and thought-out documentation I found was for the game's [Sophie's Dice](https://sophiehoulden.com/dice/documentation/notation.html#keep). Much of that syntax has been mirrored here.

Thanks, [Sophie](https://www.patreon.com/SophieHoulden)! Your examples were invaluable. Consider buying their [games](https://sophieh.itch.io/)!
