# Randsum Dice Notation

## About

### What is Dice Notation?

[Dice Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) is a way of representing different dice rolls and mutations in a simple string. For instance, `4d20+2` means "roll four twenty-sided die, then add two".

However, more complex operations - "Drop highest, reroll 3's, and make sure the rolls are unique" - do not always have a well-understood spec. This document describes the more complicated syntax that `randsum` will recognize.

## Dice Notation

Dice Notation in `randsum` is **case-insensitive**. `2d8` and `2D8` both work equally well.

### Sides And Quantity

---

```
Roll X number of Y sided die

XdY

Roll 4 twenty sided dice

4d20
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 1 twenty-sided die

roll()
roll(20)
roll('1d20')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 1
})
```

```js
// Roll 1 one-hundred-sided die

roll(100)
roll('1d100')
roll({
  sides: 100,
  quantity: 1
})
```

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die

roll('6d20')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6
})
```

### Custom Sides

---

```
Roll X number of a die with the sides "y", "z", " "

Xd{yx }

Roll 4 number of a die with the sides "+", "+", "-", "-", " ", " "

4d{++--  }
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 two-sided die with the sides "H" and "T"

roll('6d{HT}')
roll({
  sides: ['H', 'T'],
  quantity: 6
})
```

#### Custom Sides Caveats and Gotchas

- Whenever _any_ dice pool leverages custom dice, the `total` of the `RollResult` will be `0`.
- When given custom sides, `randsum` will return a `string` of comma-separated results, not a `number`.
  - For instance, `roll('6d{HT})` will return something like `"H, T, T, T, H, T"`
- Modifiers are not compatible with custom sides. Under-the-hood, `randsum` is still rolling these as if they were numeric dice, then swapping out the numbers for faces at the end. While modifiers are technically feasible, it would be very easy to code yourself into a confusing place with non-obvious results.
  - for example, given the custom faces argument `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, `1` would be considered the "highest" number, and `6` the "lowest`, which would be silly!
  - In light of this, modifiers are ignored (if provided in JS) or rejected (in TS) when providing custom sides.

### Plus

---

**Key: `+`**

Add values to the sum total of the rolled dice.

```
Add 2 to the final result

4d20+2
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, add 5

roll('6d20+5')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: { plus: 5 }
})
```

### Minus

**Key: `-`**

Subtract values to the sum total of the rolled dice

```
Subtract 2 from the final result

4d20-2
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, subtract 5

roll('6d20-5')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: { minus: 5 }
})
```

### Drop

---

Remove values from the pool of rolled dice

#### Highest

**Key: `h | H`**

Remove the highest value(s)

```
Drop Highest Die

4d20H

Drop Highest 3 Die

4d20H3
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, drop highest

roll('6d20H')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    drop: {
      highest: true
    }
  }
})

// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, drop highest 3

roll('6d20H3')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    drop: {
      highest: 3
    }
  }
})
```

#### Lowest

**Key: `l | L`**

Remove the lowest value(s)

```
Drop Lowest Die

4d20L

Drop Lowest 3 Die

4d20L3
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, drop lowest

roll('6d20L')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    drop: {
      lowest: true
    }
  }
})

// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, drop lowest 3

roll('6d20L3')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    drop: {
      lowest: 3
    }
  }
})
```

#### Greater Than, Less than, Exact

**Key: `d | D`**

Remove Dice greater than, lesser than, or equal to value(s)

```
Drop rolls greater than 17

4d20D{>17}

Drop rolls less than 5

4d20D{<5}

Drop any die that rolls a 8 or a 12

4d20D{8,12}

Mix and Match!

4d20D{<5,>158,12}
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, drop less than 5, greater than 15, and all 10's

roll('6d20D{<5,>15,10')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    drop: {
      greaterThan: 15,
      lessThan: 5,
      exactly: [10]
    }
  }
})
```

### Cap

---

**Key: `c | C`**

Reduce all values above a certain value or increase all values below a certain value

```
Cap rolls greater than 18 to be 18

4d20C>17

Cap rolls less than 4 to be 4

4d20C<4

Cap rolls less than 2 to be 2 and greater than 19 to be 19

4d20C<2>19
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, cap less than 5 and greater than 15

roll('6d20C<5>15')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    cap: {
      greaterThan: 15,
      lessThan: 5
    }
  }
})
```

### Reroll

---

**Key: `r | R`**

Reroll all values above, below, or equal to certain values

```
Reroll rolls greater than 17

4d20R{>17}

Reroll rolls less than 5

4d20R{<5}

Reroll any die that rolls a 8 or a 12

4d20R{8,12}

Reroll any die that rolls a 8 or a 12, stop rerolling after 3

4d20R{8,12}3

Mix and Match!

4d20R{<5,>15,8,12}
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, reroll less than 5, greater than 15, and all 10's, no more than 3 rerolls

roll('6d20R{<5,>15,10}3')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    reroll: {
      above: 15,
      below: 5,
      exactly: [10],
      maxReroll: 3
    }
  }
})
```

### Replace

---

**Key: `v | V`**

Replace all values above, below, or equal to certain values with other values

```
Replace any die that rolls a 8 with a 12

4d20V{8=12}

Replace rolls greater than 17 with 20

4d20V{>17=20}

Replace rolls less than 5 with 1

4d20V{<5=1}

Mix and Match!

4d20V{<5=1,>17=20,8=12}
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, replace less than 5 with 1, greater than 15 with 20, and all 10's with 2's

roll('6d20v{<5=1,>15=20,10=2')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    replace: [
      {
        from: {
          above: 15
        },
        to: 20
      },
      {
        from: {
          below: 5
        },
        to: 1
      },
      {
        from: 10,
        to: 2
      }
    ]
  }
})
```

### Unique

---

**Key: `u | U`**

Enforce all rolls in a given pool to be unique**Note: Rolls whose quantitiy of dice exceed the number of sides will fail!**

```
Force all rolls to be unique

4d20U

Allow 5's and 10's to be repeated, keep all others unique

4d20U{5,10}
```

In `randsum` :

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, make them all unique

roll('6d20U')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: { unique: true }
})

// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, make them all unique, allow for repeated 5's and 10's

roll('6d20U{5,10}')
roll({
  sides: 20,
  quantity: 6,
  modifiers: {
    unique: {
      notUnique: [5, 10]
    }
  }
})
```

### Explode

---

**Key: `!`**

Roll additional dice whenever a die in the pool rolls its maximum value

```
Roll an additional die every time you roll maximum value of a die

4d20!
```

In `randsum`:

```js
// Roll 6 twenty-sided die, explode them

roll('6d20!')
roll({ sides: 20, quantity: 6, modifiers: { explode: true } })
```

### Attribution

I looked high and wide for a consensus on a sort "Extended Standard Dice Notation", and could not find anything. The most extensive and thought-out documentation I found was for the game's [Sophie's Dice](https://sophiehoulden.com/dice/documentation/notation.html#keep). Much of that syntax has been mirrored here.

Thanks, [Sophie](https://www.patreon.com/SophieHoulden)! Your examples were invaluable. Consider buying their [games](https://sophieh.itch.io/)!
