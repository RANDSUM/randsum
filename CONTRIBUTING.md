## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing several packages:

```
packages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/         # Shared utilities and types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dice/         # Core dice rolling implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notation/      # Dice notation parser
```

Each package has its own:

- `package.json`
- `README.md`
- `src/` directory
- `__tests__/` directory
- `dist/` directory (generated)

### Package Responsibilities

- `@randsum/core`: Shared types and utilities
