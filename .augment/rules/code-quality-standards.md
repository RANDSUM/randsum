## Code Quality & Standards

- NEVER use `any` type - use proper TypeScript types
- NEVER use `as` for type assertions - use type guards instead
- Always use strict TypeScript configuration with all checks enabled
- Functional overloads should be used for proper typescript communication, but only where necessary
- Use readonly properties for immutable data structures
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Use descriptive variable and function names that explain intent
- Write self-documenting code with clear business logic
- Follow single responsibility principle for functions and classes
