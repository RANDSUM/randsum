## Performance & Bundle Size

- Prioritize tree-shakeable exports and minimal bundle size
- Use dynamic imports for large dependencies when possible
- Avoid circular dependencies between packages
- Use efficient algorithms for dice rolling and statistical calculations
- Cache expensive computations where appropriate
- Mark packages as side-effect free with `"sideEffects": false`
