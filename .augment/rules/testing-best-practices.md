## Testing Best Practices

- Create helper functions for common test patterns (e.g., createRollParameters)
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies for isolated unit tests
- Use type assertions in tests to verify TypeScript type correctness
- Group related tests with describe blocks
- Use beforeAll/afterAll for test setup and cleanup when needed
- Maintain high test coverage with meaningful tests, not just coverage targets
