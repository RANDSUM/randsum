## Development Workflow

- Use Moon commands for all development tasks: `bun moon :build`, `bun moon :test`, etc.
- Run type checking with `bun moon :tsCheck` before committing
- Use `bun moon :lint` for code quality checks
- Target individual packages with `moon [package]:task` syntax
- Use workspace commands for monorepo-wide operations
- Maintain consistent versioning across all packages
- Use semantic versioning for releases
