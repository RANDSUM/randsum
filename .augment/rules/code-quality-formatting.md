## ESLint Rules

- Explicit function return types and member accessibility required
- No `any` types allowed
- PascalCase for interfaces and type aliases
- Import sorting with member syntax order

## Prettier Configuration

- No semicolons, single quotes, 2-space indentation
- No trailing commas, 80 character line width, LF line endings
